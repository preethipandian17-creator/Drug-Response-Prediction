Drug Response Prediction

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the type of drug that should be prescribed to a patient based on their medical attributes. Using machine learning, we train a model on patient data and classify the prescribed drug into one of five categories (Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, or Drug Y).

Features (X): Patient’s medical details (Age, Sex, BP, Cholesterol, Na-to-K ratio)

Target (y): The prescribed Drug

Features

Uses Drug Dataset (Kaggle)

Data preprocessing with Label Encoding and Standard Scaling

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Model training using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluates Performance with: Accuracy Correlation Heatmap ROC-AUC Curve Precision-Recall Curve Confusion Matrix
